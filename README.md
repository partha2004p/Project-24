## Project Description
The Secure Document Notarization system allows users to notarize documents by recording a unique hash of each document on the Aptos blockchain. This ensures the document's authenticity and integrity by creating a verifiable record that confirms the document's existence without storing the document itself. This functionality is useful for legal and business contexts, where proof of document integrity and authenticity is essential.

## Project Vision
To establish a reliable, secure, and tamper-proof method for verifying the authenticity of important documents. By leveraging blockchain, this system ensures a decentralized, transparent, and immutable record of document existence and integrity.

## Key Features
- **Document Notarization**: Allows users to notarize a document by recording its hash, ensuring a timestamped record of the documentâ€™s existence.
- **Document Verification**: Provides a mechanism to verify the existence and integrity of a document by checking its hash against the blockchain record.
